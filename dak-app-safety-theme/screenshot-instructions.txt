This is a placeholder for screenshot.png

To create a proper screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of your theme's homepage at 1200x900 pixels
2. Save it as "screenshot.png" in the theme folder
3. This will be displayed in WordPress admin under Appearance > Themes

The screenshot should show what the theme looks like when activated.
